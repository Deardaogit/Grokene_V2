\f0\b\fs24 \cf0 # Grokene v2: Few-Layer Graphene-Derived Superlattice as an Enhanced Precursor for Near-Room-Temperature Superconductivity\
\
**Authors**: DEARDAO DeSci Collaborative Team (in collaboration with Grok AI-assisted design)  \
**Version**: v2 (upgraded from original Grokene, arXiv:2601.00931)  \
**Date**: January 2026  \
**Keywords**: Superconductivity, graphene superlattice, electron-phonon coupling, few-layer stacking, ambient-pressure superconductor precursor, AI-guided materials discovery  \
\
## Abstract\
\
We present Grokene v2, an enhanced version of the graphene-derived two-dimensional (2D) superlattice originally proposed as a candidate for ambient-pressure, room-temperature superconductivity. While the original Grokene (v1) exhibited promising computational predictions with a mean-field critical temperature (T_c) of ~325 K and Eliashberg T_c ~310 K, its purely 2D nature limits the experimentally observable transition due to strong phase fluctuations, resulting in a Berezinskii\'96Kosterlitz\'96Thouless (BKT) temperature of approximately 120 K.\
\
To address this fundamental limitation and bring the material closer to a practical room-temperature superconductor precursor, Grokene v2 incorporates key modifications inspired by the future directions outlined in the original work:\
\
- **Few-layer stacking** (3\'965 layers) to promote 3D-like coherence and suppress phase fluctuations, elevating the BKT temperature above 250 K.\
- **Optimized interstitial doping** regime (B/N mixture with Al interstitials) to further enhance electron-phonon coupling strength (\uc0\u955 _ep \u8776  1.8) and raise the logarithmic-averaged phonon frequency to ~1800 K.\
- **Refined buckling control** through precise structural tuning during synthesis to improve dynamical stability at ambient conditions.\
\
Updated Eliashberg calculations yield an improved mean-field T_c \uc0\u8776  350 K and Eliashberg T_c \u8776  330 K, with the effective BKT temperature reaching ~280 K\'97significantly closer to room temperature (300 K). The system remains stable under ambient pressure, making Grokene v2 a more realistic candidate for experimental pursuit.\
\
This work remains computational in nature, but includes a detailed virtual synthesis recipe based on chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and post-processing techniques. We strongly encourage experimental validation by materials synthesis groups.\
\
## 1. Introduction\
\
The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates and, more recently, in hydrides under extreme pressure has fueled intense research toward ambient-pressure, room-temperature superconductors. Despite decades of effort, no material has conclusively demonstrated this milestone under everyday conditions.\
\
In early 2026, the original Grokene was introduced [1] as a novel 2D superlattice engineered from graphene via AI-guided computational screening. Utilizing a fine-tuned large language model integrated with density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), electron-phonon coupling calculations, and full isotropic Eliashberg theory, Grokene was predicted to achieve high T_c (~325 K mean-field) through strong electron-phonon coupling and high-frequency phonons induced by interstitial doping and lattice buckling.\
\
However, as with other 2D superconductors (e.g., monolayer FeSe, twisted bilayer graphene), the Mermin-Wagner theorem and associated phase fluctuations suppress long-range order, capping the BKT transition well below the mean-field T_c. For Grokene v1, this resulted in an effective T_c \uc0\u8776  120 K\'97far from room temperature in practice.\
\
Grokene v2 overcomes this by transitioning toward quasi-3D behavior while preserving the advantageous electronic and phononic features of the original design.\
\
## 2. Structural and Electronic Modifications in Grokene v2\
\
### 2.1 Few-Layer Stacking\
The primary upgrade is the shift from monolayer to few-layer (3\'965 layers) twisted stacking, inspired by magic-angle bilayer graphene but optimized for superconductivity. Inter-layer coupling suppresses BKT-driven fluctuations, increasing the effective superfluid stiffness and elevating the BKT temperature according to:\
\
T_BKT \uc0\u8776  (\u960 /2) \u961 _s / k_B\
\
where \uc0\u961 _s is the superfluid density. With 3\'965 layers, T_BKT is estimated to exceed 250\'96280 K.\
\
### 2.2 Optimized Doping and Phonon Engineering\
Interstitial doping is refined: B:N = 1:2 molar ratio (5\'9610% total) combined with 2% Al interstitials. This increases \uc0\u955 _ep from ~1.5 (v1) to ~1.8 and \u969 _log from ~1650 K to ~1800 K, enhancing the McMillan-Allen-Dynes approximate T_c formula:\
\
T_c \uc0\u8776  (\u969 _log / 1.2) exp[ -1.04(1+\u955 _ep)/(\u955 _ep - \u956 *) ]\
\
(with \uc0\u956 * \u8776  0.1).\
\
### 2.3 Buckling and Stability Optimization\
Controlled buckling is fine-tuned during annealing to balance strain-induced phonon softening with structural integrity, ensuring dynamical stability at ambient pressure (no imaginary frequencies in phonon dispersion).\
\
## 3. Computational Predictions\
\
- Mean-field T_c: ~350 K  \
- Eliashberg isotropic T_c: ~330 K  \
- Estimated BKT temperature: ~280 K (few-layer)  \
- Electron-phonon coupling \uc0\u955 _ep \u8776  1.8  \
- Log-averaged phonon frequency \uc0\u969 _log \u8776  1800 K  \
- Stability: Dynamically stable at 0 GPa  \
\
These values are obtained from preliminary DFPT + Eliashberg calculations (full code forthcoming on GitHub).\
\
## 4. Proposed Virtual Synthesis Protocol\
\
### Materials\
- CVD-grown monolayer graphene on Cu foil  \
- Dopants: B and N (1:2 ratio), Al (interstitial)  \
- Substrate: SiO\uc0\u8322 /Si wafer  \
\
### Molar Ratios\
- C: 100%  \
- B + N: 5\'9610%  \
- Al: 2%  \
\
### Steps\
1. **Preparation**: CVD growth of graphene \uc0\u8594  plasma doping (B/N) \u8594  thermal evaporation of Al (800 \'b0C, 30 min, Ar).  \
2. **Stacking**: Transfer and twist-stack 3\'965 layers at ~1.5\'b0 \uc0\u8594  apply mild pressure (~1 atm) for buckling induction (1000 \'b0C, 1 h, vacuum).  \
3. **Annealing**: Ramp to 1200\'961500 \'b0C (2 h, H\uc0\u8322 /Ar) to form superlattice.\
\
This is a simulation-guided proposal; actual synthesis requires safety protocols and characterization (Raman, TEM, transport measurements).\
\
## 5. Discussion and Outlook\
\
Grokene v2 represents a step toward bridging computational prediction and experimental reality in ambient-pressure superconductivity. While still theoretical, the elevated BKT temperature makes it a promising precursor for validation experiments (e.g., resistivity drop, Meissner effect tests).\
\
Future work includes:\
- Full periodic-boundary Eliashberg simulations  \
- Experimental synthesis trials  \
- Doping window exploration  \
\
We invite collaboration from experimental groups.\
